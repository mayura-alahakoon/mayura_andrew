I played many games and watched animal videos on YouTube. When I was in grade 10, I found a Sri Lankan YouTube channel called Hacking.lk which featured hacking-related content. I became curious about hacking and installed Kali Linux to try many things I learned from those videos. However, it was limited as I had to focus on my schoolwork. During high school, I studied IT and had the chance to work with LibreOffice for the first time. I still use LibreOffice for academics, and I also learned about the disadvantages of using cracked software. I will discuss these disadvantages in my next article.Let's dive into the main reasons why I use open-source software. Firstly, it's free. Open-source software doesn't cost anything, which is cool. As a Sri Lankan student, I cannot personally afford to pay subscriptions or any payment for software that I need to use daily due to my financial background. This is my main reason.Secondly, we can trust open-source software because most of it is community-driven. It has communities all around the world, and the source code is available to anyone. When compared to closed software, we know they provide better software, but we do not know how they choose our personal details for marketing, etc. I know most of us never read terms and conditions in particular software; we just click click click... I know that, but it is not a good practice.Thirdly, the community is one reason I love open-source software. If you have a particular issue with your software, you can fix it easily by collaborating with the community. The community will help you to fix it, and you can learn more new things from them.Fourthly, there are many free alternative software options available for all of our work. For instance, if you are a video editor, most of you are using Adobe products. I am not saying that these software options are not good; they are excellent if you use them legally. But if you are using cracked versions, you can use open-source software like Blender. The first step is to search on the internet, and you can find whatever you want in open-source.If you are using cracked software, just think about how developers developed that software, their time, and sacrifice. We have to give credit to them. If they had not developed that software, how would you use it? How would you get money from your project? Just think about doing your best to value the developers.This is what I want to say. Thank you for your time reading this. This is my first article, and I'll continue it.In conclusion, my journey as an open-source enthusiast started with my curiosity about hacking and exploring Kali Linux. I discovered the advantages of using open-source software, including its cost-effectiveness, trustworthiness, supportive community, and the availability of free alternatives. It is crucial to appreciate and give credit to the developers who sacrifice their time and effort to develop these software options. As a Sri Lankan student with limited financial resources, open-source software has been a game-changer for me. I encourage others to explore these options and support the open-source community.","i-would-love-to-hear-your-thoughts-and-feedback-on-my-frist-article-#I would love to hear your thoughts and feedback on my frist article üòÅ":""}},"/tags/[tag]":{"title":"Tagged Posts","data":{"":""}},"/projects":{"title":"projectsüöÄ","data":{"":"Here's my current projectsüöÄThis is a my new project,a free online resources library that will be a\ncommunity-driven learning platform.

Whether you're working on a team project, building a web application, or experimenting with machine learning, you need a consistent, efficient, and portable runtime environment to ensure that your code runs smoothly.This is where containers come in. Containers are a lightweight, standalone executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application, including code, libraries, dependencies, and runtime. Containers are designed to be portable, meaning they can run on any machine with the appropriate container runtime installed, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.In this article, we'll explore why it's important for computer science students to understand containers and provide examples of how they can be used in university projects.","why-are-containers-important-for-computer-science-students#Why are containers important for computer science students?":"There are several reasons why it's important for computer science students to understand containers:Efficiency: Containers are much more lightweight than virtual machines (VMs), which means they use fewer resources and can be started and stopped more quickly. This makes them ideal for running multiple applications on a single machine or for deploying applications in a cloud environment where resources are shared.Consistency: Containers provide a consistent runtime environment, regardless of where the application is deployed. This means that developers can write code once and run it anywhere, without having to worry about differences in the underlying infrastructure.Reproducibility: Containers make it easy to reproduce application environments, which is essential for debugging and testing. Developers can create a container image that includes all the necessary dependencies and configurations, and then share that image with others to ensure everyone is working with the same environment.Portability: Containers are designed to be portable, meaning they can run on any machine with the appropriate container runtime installed, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This makes them ideal for deploying applications in a cloud environment where resources are shared.Security: Containers provide a secure runtime environment, which means that applications running inside a container are isolated from the host system and other containers. This reduces the risk of malicious code or vulnerabilities affecting the host system or other containers.","how-can-containers-be-used-in-university-projects#How can containers be used in university projects?":"","here-are-some-examples-of-how-containers-can-be-used-in-university-projects#Here are some examples of how containers can be used in university projects:":"Database Management: In a database management project, you might need to use multiple database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. Instead of installing these systems on your computer, you can create a container that includes all the required systems and dependencies. This container can then be shared with your team members, ensuring that everyone is working with the same environment.Web Development: In a web development project, you might need to use different web frameworks and programming languages such as Node.js, Ruby on Rails, or Django. Instead of installing each of these frameworks and languages on your computer, you can create a container that includes all the required frameworks and dependencies. This container can be easily shared with your team members, ensuring consistency and reducing the likelihood of environment-related bugs.Machine Learning: In a machine learning project, you might need to use different machine learning libraries and frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn. Instead of installing each of these libraries and frameworks on your computer, you can create a container that includes all the required libraries and dependencies. This container can be easily shared with your team members, ensuring consistency and reducing the likelihood of environment-related bugs.\nBy using containers in these types of university projects, students can simplify the process of setting up and deploying the required software, ensure consistency across team members, and reduce the likelihood of environment-related bugs.","conclusion#Conclusion":"In conclusion, containers are an important tool for computer science students to understand. They provide a lightweight, efficient, and consistent runtime environment that can be used for development, testing, and production deployment. By learning about containers and using them in university projects, students can gain valuable skills and experience that will prepare them for real-world challenges in the software industry.Note that this article generated from ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/chat) and edited by me.","resources#Resources":"IBM\nDocker\nRedHat\nWikipedia\nPodman\nKubernetes"}},"/posts/Discover-Golang:-A-Beginner's-Guide":{"title":"A Beginner's Guide and Free Resources to Learn Golang from an Early Stage Gopher","data":{"":"","what-is-go#What is Go?":"Go, often referred to as Golang, is an open-source programming language created by Google engineers Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
