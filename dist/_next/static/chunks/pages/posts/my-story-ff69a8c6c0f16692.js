I played many games and watched animal videos on YouTube. When I was in grade 10, I found a Sri Lankan YouTube channel called Hacking.lk which featured hacking-related content. I became curious about hacking and installed Kali Linux to try many things I learned from those videos. However, it was limited as I had to focus on my schoolwork. During high school, I studied IT and had the chance to work with LibreOffice for the first time. I still use LibreOffice for academics, and I also learned about the disadvantages of using cracked software. I will discuss these disadvantages in my next article."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Let's dive into the main reasons why I use open-source software. Firstly, it's free.

This is my main reason."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Secondly, we can trust open-source software because most of it is community-driven. It has communities all around the world, and the source code is available to anyone.

For instance, if you are a video editor, most of you are using Adobe products. I am not saying that these software options are not good; they are excellent if you use them legally. But if you are using cracked versions, you can use open-source software like Blender. The first step is to search on the internet, and you can find whatever you want in open-source."}),"\n",(0,o.jsx)(t.p,{children:"If you are using cracked software, just think about how developers developed that software, their time, and sacrifice.

It is crucial to appreciate and give credit to the developers who sacrifice their time and effort to develop these software options.
